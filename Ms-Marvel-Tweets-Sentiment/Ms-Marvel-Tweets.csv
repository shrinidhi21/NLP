1548878277128949761,,2022-07-18 03:52:12,Saw the final 2 episodes of #MsMarvel and yeah they didn't change my opinion about the show. Just sloppy all around. They need to stop putting so many of these shows out and spend more time making each one. 6 episodes is too short for all that they try to cram in. Just messy,['MsMarvel']

Worth watching!!
